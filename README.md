https://homework-15-dbk.herokuapp.com/

This project uses data from the bellybutton.sqlite and belly_button_biodiversity.sqlite files. 

There are samples taken from from different people and using Java D3 I create a pie chart, bubble chart,
and table to help describe the data further. You can choose from different samples from a drop down menu
and the table, pie chart and bubble chart update themselfs. The pie and bubble chart help show the 
percentages of bacteria each sample have. The table shows the information on the person the sample was
taken from. If you hover your mouse over the pie and bubble chart you can see the type of bacteria being
described.
